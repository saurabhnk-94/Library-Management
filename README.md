# Library Management System 

In this app there are multiple libraries. In each library there are multiple librarians and books. So basically a member can borrow a book from the library only if he is a member.

###Functionalities and assumptions:
 1. Book is issued by the librarian and then has to be returned within a due date of 7 days.
 2. If at all he doesn't return the book on or before the due date he is going to pay the fine as assigned by the library standards.
 3. I have implemented the concept of #####post_save so that as soon the book is returned and the book is shown available for the upcoming booking members.
 4. A member can borrow only limited books from the library.
